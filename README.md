# red_black_tree_cpp
Implementation of red-black tree in CPP. Includes code insertion, deletion of indvidiual node, re-balancing tree, deleting all nodes on tree off of heap and checking for the properties of a red black tree (no double reds,each path has equal black depth, root is black). Also include test file which constructs some trees, deletes a node, and checks for if subsequent tree is indeed legitimate red-black tree (then cleans all trees off of heap that were created by new() to avoid memory leakage)
