# red_black_tree_cpp
Implementation of red-black tree in CPP. Includes code insertion, deletion, re-balancing tree, and checking for the properties of a red black tree (no double reds,each path has equal black depth, root is black). Also include test file which constructs some trees, deletes a node, and checks for if subsequent tree is indeed legitimate red-black tree.
